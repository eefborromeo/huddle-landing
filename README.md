## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my submission for the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) - Hubble Landing Page with Alternating Feature blocks challenge.

## The Challenge

My personal goal for this challenge was to build the project using Bootstrap 4.

The challenge is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder.

The designs are in JPG static format and to use best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This challenge should help train to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.
